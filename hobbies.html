                Sam has a number of different hobbies she has enjoyed for a long time but the most important to her is reading. She has been reading books for as long as she can remember and always loves to be transported into a different world. She prefers to
                read physical books but has taken to using her phone recently due to the convenience while having her baby with her. 
                <br /><br />
                In addition to reading she enjoys a number of different video games. Notably her entire family has at some points played
                World of Warcraft which is where she met her now husband. She also enjoys playing League of Legends where she loves to play as a character named Soraka that is dedicated to keeping her team alive. In addition to video games she also enjoys
                board games. With a small group of friends she plays Dungeons and Dragons every week and her husband is the game master. During these games she typically plays as a druid and loves to turn into all different kinds of animals to see what kind 
                of trouble she can stir up.
